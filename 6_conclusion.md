## Conclusion

The declarative approach allows you to describe what you want to accomplish rather than how you want to do it, which can make the code easier to read and maintain in the long term. This can be particularly useful for complex applications with many user interactions.

Don't think RxJS is over complicated, it gives you the tools necessary to deal with complex issues in applications.

However if it is too complicated for you, you can stick to an imperative approach, as the main goal we are trying to achieve here is to write maintainable and bug free applications. 

You have to choose the more comfortable approach that gives you power to ensure everything's work as expected.

Ultimately, there is no good or bad code, there are simply different approaches that may be suitable for different needs. As a developer, you should choose the approach that best suits your situation and personal preferences.
